# Prompt Templates

This directory contains prompt templates used by Coda Lite:

- `system.txt`: System prompt for the LLM
- `tools.txt`: Tool-specific prompt for structured output

These files are created with default values when Coda Lite runs for the first time.
You can customize them to change Coda's personality and behavior.
