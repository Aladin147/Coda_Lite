# Test Results and Analysis

This document summarizes the results of our initial test run and provides an analysis of the issues found.

## Summary

- **Total Test Files**: 7
- **Passed Test Files**: 1
- **Failed Test Files**: 6
- **Total Tests**: 57
- **Passed Tests**: 30
- **Failed Tests**: 27

## Passing Tests

The following tests are passing:

- All TextInput component tests (11 tests)
- Some WebSocketClient tests (8 tests)
- Some MessageQueue tests (2 tests)
- Some VoiceControls tests (2 tests)

## Failing Tests

### 1. WebSocketClient Tests

- **should return correct connection status**: The mock WebSocket's readyState is set to OPEN, but the client's isConnected() method is returning false.
- **should handle multiple messages sent in quick succession**: There's an issue with accessing the socket property of the mock WebSocket.

### 2. MessageQueue Tests

- **should process messages in order**: The test expects the send method to be called once, but it's being called three times.
- **should handle rapid message enqueueing**: The test expects the send method to be called once, but it's being called ten times.
- **should clear the queue**: The test expects the send method to be called once, but it's being called five times.

### 3. VoiceControls Tests

- Most tests are failing because they're looking for elements with text "Start Listening" and "Stop Listening", but the actual component uses "Hold to Speak" instead.

### 4. WebSocketDebugger Tests

- Several tests are failing because they're finding multiple elements with the same text.
- The test for toggling event expansion is failing because it's finding multiple elements with the text "test_event".

### 5. StressTest Tests

- **should handle concurrent message sending with delayed responses**: The test is timing out.
- **should handle message sending during reconnection**: The test expects 10 messages to be sent, but 20 are being sent.

## Analysis

1. **Component Text Mismatch**: The VoiceControls tests are looking for text that doesn't match what's in the actual component. We need to update either the tests or the component to match.

2. **Multiple Elements with Same Text**: The WebSocketDebugger tests are finding multiple elements with the same text. We need to use more specific selectors or use getAllByText instead of getByText.

3. **Mock WebSocket Issues**: The WebSocketClient tests are having issues with the mock WebSocket. We need to ensure the mock correctly simulates the WebSocket behavior.

4. **MessageQueue Implementation**: The MessageQueue tests are failing because the implementation is sending messages immediately instead of queuing them. We need to update the implementation to match the expected behavior.

5. **Timing Issues**: The StressTest tests are having timing issues. We need to properly mock timers and ensure the tests don't time out.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix VoiceControls Tests**: Update the tests to match the actual component text.

2. **Fix WebSocketDebugger Tests**: Use more specific selectors or use getAllByText instead of getByText.

3. **Fix WebSocketClient Tests**: Update the mock WebSocket to correctly simulate the WebSocket behavior.

4. **Fix MessageQueue Implementation**: Update the implementation to match the expected behavior.

5. **Fix StressTest Tests**: Properly mock timers and ensure the tests don't time out.

6. **Add More Tests**: Add tests for other components and edge cases.

7. **Implement Message Queuing**: Based on the test results, we should implement a message queuing system to prevent concurrent writes to the WebSocket.

## Conclusion

The initial test run has revealed several issues with our WebSocket implementation. By addressing these issues, we can improve the reliability and robustness of our implementation. The most critical issue to address is the potential for concurrent writes to the WebSocket, which could be causing the asyncio errors we're seeing in the Coda backend.
