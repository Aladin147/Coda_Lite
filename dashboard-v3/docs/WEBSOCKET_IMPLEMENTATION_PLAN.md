# WebSocket Implementation Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for improving the WebSocket implementation in the Coda Dashboard v3.

## Background

The dashboard communicates with the Coda backend using WebSockets. We've identified issues with the current implementation:

1. **Duplicate/Concurrent Messages**: The dashboard may be sending duplicate or concurrent messages, causing asyncio errors in the backend.
2. **Connection Stability**: Connection management needs improvement to handle reconnections and error states.
3. **Code Complexity**: The current implementation has unnecessary abstraction layers making debugging difficult.

## Goals

1. Identify and fix the root causes of duplicate/concurrent messages
2. Implement fail-safe mechanisms to prevent issues even when root causes aren't fully addressed
3. Create a comprehensive test suite to verify the implementation
4. Improve debugging tools and documentation
5. Ensure a reliable and maintainable WebSocket implementation

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

### Instrumented Logging
- Add detailed timestamped logging throughout the WebSocket message flow
- Assign unique IDs to each message for tracking through the system
- Log at key points: message creation, send attempt, send success/failure

### Event Flow Tracing
- Trace the complete path from user action to WebSocket message
- Identify all components involved in the message creation and sending process
- Document the expected vs. actual flow of events

### React Component Analysis
- Audit React hooks for missing dependency arrays
- Check for event handlers defined inside render functions
- Verify proper memoization of callbacks with useCallback
- Analyze component re-rendering patterns

### Event Listener Audit
- Check for duplicate event listener registrations
- Verify proper cleanup of event listeners in useEffect
- Look for overlapping event listeners at different component levels

### Network Analysis
- Use browser DevTools to capture WebSocket frames
- Analyze timing patterns between duplicate messages
- Look for correlations between UI actions and message bursts

## 2. Implement Fail-Safe Mechanisms

### Message Queuing System
- Implement a sequential message queue to prevent concurrent sends
- Add configurable delay between messages
- Include retry logic for failed sends

### Message Deduplication
- Add message fingerprinting to detect duplicates
- Implement a short-term cache of recently sent messages
- Filter out duplicate messages before sending

### Connection Management
- Improve connection state tracking
- Ensure proper cleanup of old connections before creating new ones
- Add heartbeat mechanism to detect stale connections

## 3. Comprehensive Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test WebSocketClient in isolation with mocked WebSocket
- Test message queue implementation
- Test deduplication logic

### Integration Tests
- Test interaction between components and WebSocket service
- Verify proper message flow from UI actions to WebSocket sends
- Test reconnection and error handling scenarios

### Stress Tests
- Test rapid message sending
- Test connection drops and reconnects
- Test concurrent user actions

### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete flow from UI to backend response
- Verify proper handling of all message types
- Test with actual backend (not mocked)

### Continuous Testing
- Add tests alongside each new feature or fix
- Ensure tests cover both success and failure paths
- Maintain high test coverage for WebSocket-related code

## 4. Implementation Improvements

### Refactor WebSocketClient
- Simplify the implementation based on what we know works
- Remove unnecessary abstraction layers
- Add robust error handling and logging

### Improve React Integration
- Ensure proper use of React hooks
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use proper memoization for callbacks and event handlers

### Enhance Debugging Tools
- Improve WebSocketDebugger to show more detailed information
- Add message history with timing information
- Add ability to replay messages for testing

### Documentation Updates
- Document the WebSocket protocol and message formats
- Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Update development guidelines with best practices

## 5. Verification and Monitoring

### Backend Error Monitoring
- Monitor asyncio errors in the Python backend
- Correlate errors with specific message patterns
- Verify reduction in errors after fixes

### Performance Metrics
- Track message latency and throughput
- Monitor connection stability
- Measure impact of fixes on overall performance

### User Experience Testing
- Verify that fixes don't negatively impact user experience
- Ensure UI remains responsive during WebSocket operations
- Test with various network conditions

## 6. Phased Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Instrumentation and Analysis (Current)
- Add logging and debugging tools
- Identify patterns in duplicate messages
- Document findings and hypotheses

### Phase 2: Critical Fixes
- Implement fixes for the most likely root causes
- Add fail-safe mechanisms (queue, deduplication)
- Test fixes in isolation

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing
- Implement full test suite
- Verify fixes with automated tests
- Document test results and remaining issues

### Phase 4: Refinement and Optimization
- Optimize message handling for performance
- Refine error handling and recovery
- Improve user feedback during connection issues

### Phase 5: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
- Update all documentation with findings and solutions
- Create developer guidelines for WebSocket usage
- Document lessons learned for future reference

## Current Status

We are currently in Phase 1: Instrumentation and Analysis. We have:

1. Created a simplified WebSocketClient implementation based on the original working dashboard
2. Added initial tests for the WebSocketClient and related components
3. Identified potential issues through test results
4. Created documentation for the current implementation

## Next Steps

1. Add instrumented logging to the WebSocketClient
2. Create a message debugging tool in the WebSocketDebugger
3. Analyze React component lifecycle and event handling
4. Test with simplified components to isolate issues
5. Implement message queuing as a fail-safe mechanism

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (Instrumentation and Analysis): 1-2 days
- Phase 2 (Critical Fixes): 2-3 days
- Phase 3 (Comprehensive Testing): 2-3 days
- Phase 4 (Refinement and Optimization): 1-2 days
- Phase 5 (Documentation and Knowledge Transfer): 1 day

Total estimated time: 7-11 days
