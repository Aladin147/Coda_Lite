# Coda Architecture Transformation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to transform Coda's architecture into a modular, WebSocket-based system that decouples the core AI functionality from the UI. This transformation will enhance performance, improve maintainability, and provide a foundation for future growth.

## Core Architecture Vision

Coda will be restructured as a modular voice-first AI assistant with:

1. **CLI Backend**: Contains all core logic, memory, and processing
2. **WebSocket Interface**: Provides real-time event streaming
3. **Tauri Dashboard**: Optional UI that observes but doesn't control the core

## Key Components Recap

### 1. Event System

- **Versioned Schema**: JSON-based events with version, sequence numbers, and timestamps
- **Validation**: Pydantic for development, optional in production
- **Example Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "version": "1.0",
    "seq": 143,
    "timestamp": 1713943123.771,
    "type": "memory_event",
    "session_id": "cli-01",
    "data": { ... }
  }
  ```

### 2. Performance Monitoring

- **PerfTracker**: Marks key points in processing pipeline
- **Memory & CPU Tracking**: System resource monitoring
- **GPU Tracking**: Optional VRAM usage for CUDA operations
- **Example Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "sys_metrics",
    "memory_mb": 387,
    "cpu_percent": 19.4,
    "gpu_vram_mb": 1024
  }
  ```

### 3. Graceful Degradation

- **Silent Failure**: Core continues if UI disconnects
- **Client Pruning**: Auto-remove dead connections
- **Replay Buffer**: Store recent important events for reconnection
- **Example Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "replay",
    "events": [ ... ]
  }
  ```

### 4. Security Model

- **Local-Only Default**: No external connections by default
- **Token Authentication**: Optional for remote access
- **Token Rotation**: Support for expiring and regenerating tokens
- **Access Logging**: Track all connection attempts

### 5. Error Handling

- **Structured Errors**: Errors as events in the stream
- **Isolation**: UI errors don't affect core functionality
- **Example Format**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "error",
    "level": "warning",
    "message": "TTS failed, retrying..."
  }
  ```

### 6. Configuration System

- **Central Config**: Single source of truth in config files
- **Profile Support**: Different configurations for different environments
- **Read-Only UI**: Dashboard can view but not modify core config

### 7. Versioning Strategy

- **Protocol Versioning**: Include version in all messages
- **Compatibility Checks**: UI verifies compatibility with core
- **Semantic Versioning**: Clear version scheme for core and UI

### 8. Documentation

- **Event Documentation**: Complete reference for all event types
- **Architecture Docs**: System design and flow diagrams
- **Extension Guides**: How to add new components and events

### 9. Monitoring & Alerting

- **Threshold Alerts**: Notifications when metrics exceed thresholds
- **Visual Indicators**: Dashboard color changes for status
- **Optional Notifications**: Sound or visual cues for critical issues

## Success Metrics

The success of this architecture transformation will be measured by:

1. **Latency**: No increase in end-to-end response time
2. **Stability**: Reduced error rates and improved recovery
3. **Observability**: Complete visibility into system operation
4. **Maintainability**: Easier debugging and feature addition
5. **Extensibility**: Ability to add new components without disruption

## Dashboard Implementation Plan

As part of our architecture transformation, we are implementing a React-based Tauri dashboard with the following key features:

### Core Dashboard Components

1. **Speaking Animation**: Visual feedback when Coda is speaking
   - Pulsing rings around Coda's avatar
   - Triggered by TTS events

2. **Real-Time Event Log**: Chronological display of system events
   - Scrollable timeline with icons and timestamps
   - Categorized by event type (STT, LLM, TTS, etc.)

3. **Latency Monitor**: Performance visualization
   - Horizontal stacked bars for processing stages
   - Color-coded performance indicators

4. **Memory Viewer**: Insight into Coda's memory system
   - Display of recent memories
   - Memory statistics and metrics

5. **Tool Usage Cards**: Visualization of tool calls
   - Display of tool parameters and results
   - Status indicators for pending/completed calls

### Implementation Approach

- **React + Tauri**: Using React for UI components within Tauri framework
- **WebSocket Integration**: Direct connection to Coda's WebSocket server
- **Reactive UI**: State management with React hooks and context
- **CSS Animations**: Lightweight, performant animations for visual feedback
- **Modular Components**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability

### Performance Considerations

- Dashboard runs as a separate process from Coda's core
- Asynchronous, non-blocking communication via WebSockets
- Efficient React patterns to minimize render cycles
- Lazy loading of components to reduce initial load time
- Adaptive throttling for high-frequency events

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a comprehensive plan for transforming Coda's architecture into a modular, observable, and resilient system. By following this plan, we will create a foundation that supports Coda's evolution while maintaining its core principles of speed, reliability, and modularity.

The decoupling of core functionality from the UI will resolve current issues with memory system integration while providing a platform for future enhancements. The React-based Tauri dashboard will provide a visual interface for monitoring and interacting with Coda, enhancing both development and user experience.

This architecture ensures that Coda remains "a system, not a gimmick" that can evolve into a full digital operator.
