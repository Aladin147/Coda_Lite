# Coda Lite - Development Journal

This journal tracks the development progress, decisions, challenges, and insights gained during the development of Coda Lite.

## April 21, 2023 - Project Initialization

**Activities:**
- Created GitHub repository with README and LICENSE
- Established initial project structure
- Set up basic module placeholders
- Created documentation framework

**Decisions:**
- Chose faster-whisper for STT due to its efficiency and accuracy
- Selected Ollama as the LLM interface for local model management
- Opted for CSM-1B for TTS based on quality and performance
- Implemented a modular design to allow easy component swapping

**Challenges:**
- Balancing between comprehensive functionality and maintaining low latency
- Determining the optimal project structure for future extensibility

**Next Steps:**
- Set up development environment
- Implement basic STT functionality
- Establish LLM connection
- Create TTS integration

**Notes:**
- Initial focus will be on creating a functional voice loop before adding tools
- Need to research optimal model sizes for balancing quality and performance
