# Coda Lite Comprehensive Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for Coda Lite, incorporating feedback from the technical audit and subsequent analysis. The plan focuses on building a robust, modular, and scalable AI assistant platform with advanced memory capabilities, personality customization, and high performance.

## Core Principles

1. **Modular First, Optimized Later**:
   - Focus on clean interfaces and modularity
   - Defer optimization until we have performance data
   - Use feature flags to gradually roll out new architecture

2. **Observability as a First-Class Concern**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging from day one
   - Add performance tracking to all critical paths
   - Create dashboards for system health monitoring

3. **Incremental Refactoring**:
   - Break large refactors into smaller, testable chunks
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transitions
   - Use the strangler pattern for replacing components

4. **Plugin Architecture**:
   - Design for extensibility from the beginning
   - Create a plugin system for tools and capabilities
   - Document extension points and interfaces
