# LLM Migration Plan: Gemma 2B

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to migrate Coda Lite's primary LLM from the current model to Gemma 2B. This migration is scheduled to begin tomorrow.

## Rationale

Gemma 2B has been selected as our primary LLM for the following reasons:

- **More fluent than Phi**: Produces more natural and coherent responses
- **Faster than LLaMA 3 8B**: Lower latency for real-time conversation
- **Good instruction-following**: Follows user instructions accurately
- **Great for real-time conversation**: Optimized for interactive dialogue

These advantages make Gemma 2B an ideal choice for Coda Lite, which prioritizes responsive, natural conversation with low latency.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Testing

1. **Install and Configure Gemma 2B**
   - Download the Gemma 2B model
   - Configure Ollama to serve Gemma 2B
   - Set up appropriate quantization for optimal performance

2. **Benchmark Performance**
   - Measure response generation time
   - Evaluate memory usage
   - Test with various prompt lengths
   - Compare with current LLM implementation

3. **Quality Assessment**
   - Test instruction-following capabilities
   - Evaluate response coherence and fluency
   - Assess personality consistency
   - Test memory integration

### Phase 2: Integration

1. **Update LLM Module**
   - Modify the LLM module to support Gemma 2B
   - Implement model-specific optimizations
   - Update prompt templates if needed

2. **Implement Fallback Mechanism**
   - Keep current LLM as fallback option
   - Create automatic switching logic based on performance or errors

3. **Update Configuration**
   - Add Gemma 2B configuration options
   - Document new configuration parameters
   - Create migration guide for users

### Phase 3: Optimization

1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Optimize system prompts for Gemma 2B
   - Fine-tune personality integration
   - Adjust memory context formatting

2. **Performance Tuning**
   - Optimize batch size and context length
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Fine-tune token budget allocation

3. **Integration with Debugging Tools**
   - Add Gemma-specific metrics to ConversationPipelineDebugger
   - Implement model-specific performance tracking

## Success Metrics

The migration will be considered successful if:

1. **Performance**:
   - Average response time decreases by at least 20%
   - Memory usage remains stable or decreases

2. **Quality**:
   - Instruction-following accuracy meets or exceeds current model
   - User satisfaction with responses increases
   - Personality consistency is maintained or improved

3. **Stability**:
   - No increase in error rates
   - Successful integration with memory system
   - Seamless fallback to alternative model when needed

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Setup and initial testing
- **Day 2-3**: Integration with LLM module
- **Day 4-5**: Prompt optimization and performance tuning
- **Day 6-7**: Final testing and documentation

## Conclusion

Migrating to Gemma 2B as our primary LLM represents a significant improvement for Coda Lite. The model's fluency, speed, instruction-following capabilities, and conversational abilities align perfectly with our goals of creating a responsive, natural AI assistant.

This migration is a key step in our ongoing efforts to improve Coda Lite's performance and user experience, and it aligns with our comprehensive development plan's focus on stability and performance optimization.
