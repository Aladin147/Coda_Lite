# Memory System Tests Documentation

## Overview

The memory system tests provide comprehensive validation of Coda's memory capabilities, ensuring that both short-term and long-term memory components function correctly. These tests cover all aspects of the memory system, including memory encoding, retrieval, persistence, and WebSocket integration.

## Test Coverage

The memory system tests cover the following components:

### 1. Short-Term Memory
- Conversation turn management
- Context generation with token limits
- Memory export and import
- Deque maxlen behavior for conversation history

### 2. Long-Term Memory
- Memory addition and retrieval
- Vector database integration (ChromaDB, SQLite, in-memory)
- Memory persistence across sessions
- Memory pruning when maximum capacity is reached
- Semantic search by content similarity
- Metadata-based search
- Topic extraction and management

### 3. Enhanced Memory Manager
- Integration of short-term and long-term memory
- Fact and preference storage
- Automatic memory persistence
- Enhanced context generation with relevant memories
- Topic extraction from user messages

### 4. WebSocket Memory Integration
- Event emission for memory operations
- Duplicate message detection
- Memory persistence with WebSocket events
- Memory retrieval with WebSocket events

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into the following modules:

- `test_base.py`: Base test class with common setup/teardown logic
- `test_short_term_memory.py`: Tests for the short-term memory system
- `test_long_term_memory.py`: Tests for the long-term memory system
- `test_enhanced_memory_manager.py`: Tests for the enhanced memory manager
- `test_websocket_memory.py`: Tests for the WebSocket-enhanced memory manager
- `test_utils/memory_test_utils.py`: Utility classes and functions for testing
- `run_memory_tests.py`: Script to run all memory tests

## Test Implementation Details

### Test Utilities

The `memory_test_utils.py` file contains mock implementations of the memory system components:

- `TestShortTermMemory`: Mock implementation of the short-term memory system
- `TestLongTermMemory`: Mock implementation of the long-term memory system
- `TestMemoryEncoder`: Mock implementation of the memory encoder
- `TestEnhancedMemoryManager`: Mock implementation of the enhanced memory manager
- `CodaWebSocketIntegration`: Mock implementation of the WebSocket integration

These mock implementations allow for controlled testing of the memory system without dependencies on external systems.

### Test Base Class

The `MemoryTestBase` class provides common setup and teardown logic for all memory tests:

- Creates a unique test ID for each test run
- Sets up test directories for memory data
- Provides a default configuration for testing
- Cleans up test data after tests complete

### Short-Term Memory Tests

The `ShortTermMemoryTest` class tests the following aspects of the short-term memory system:

- Adding conversation turns
- Exporting and importing memory
- Generating context with token limits
- Managing turn count
- Handling maxlen behavior for the conversation history
- Resetting memory
- Token counting for context generation

### Long-Term Memory Tests

The `LongTermMemoryTest` class tests the following aspects of the long-term memory system:

- Adding memories
- Adding topics
- Retrieving all memories
- Retrieving memories by ID
- Getting memory statistics
- Initializing with different vector database backends (ChromaDB, SQLite, in-memory)
- Memory persistence across instances
- Memory pruning when maximum capacity is reached
- Searching memories by metadata
- Searching memories by semantic similarity

### Enhanced Memory Manager Tests

The `EnhancedMemoryManagerTest` class tests the following aspects of the enhanced memory manager:

- Adding facts to long-term memory
- Adding preferences to long-term memory
- Adding conversation turns
- Automatic persistence of short-term memory
- Clearing short-term memory
- Getting enhanced context with relevant memories
- Initialization with default parameters
- Full integration of short-term and long-term memory
- Persisting short-term memory to long-term memory
- Retrieving relevant memories for a query
- Topic extraction from user messages

### WebSocket Memory Tests

The `WebSocketMemoryTest` class tests the following aspects of the WebSocket-enhanced memory manager:

- Adding memories with WebSocket events
- Adding conversation turns with WebSocket events
- Clearing short-term memory with WebSocket events
- Duplicate message detection in WebSocket integration
- Getting enhanced context with WebSocket events
- Getting memories with WebSocket events
- Initialization with WebSocket integration
- Memory persistence with WebSocket events

## Running the Tests

To run all memory tests, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
python tests/memory/run_memory_tests.py
```

This will run all the tests and generate a comprehensive report in the `data/memory/test/results` directory.

## Test Results

Test results are saved in the following locations:

- Test logs: `data/memory/test/results/memory_tests_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`
- Test report: `data/memory/test/results/test_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

The test report includes:
- Total number of tests run
- Number of tests passed, failed, and skipped
- Success rate
- Duration of the test run
- Details of any failures

## Recent Improvements

The memory system tests have been recently improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Robust Mock Implementations**: Enhanced mock implementations of memory system components to better simulate real-world behavior
2. **Improved Test Isolation**: Each test now runs in its own isolated environment with a unique test directory
3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling and reporting for test failures
4. **WebSocket Integration Tests**: Added comprehensive tests for WebSocket integration with the memory system
5. **System Message Preservation**: Fixed tests for system message preservation in the conversation history
6. **Memory Pruning Tests**: Enhanced tests for memory pruning to ensure the most important memories are preserved
7. **Search Functionality Tests**: Improved tests for memory search functionality with better mock implementations

## Future Test Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the memory system tests include:

1. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for memory system performance under load
2. **Stress Testing**: Add tests for memory system behavior with large numbers of memories
3. **Concurrency Testing**: Add tests for memory system behavior with concurrent access
4. **Integration Testing**: Add more comprehensive integration tests with other Coda components
5. **Fault Injection**: Add tests for memory system behavior under failure conditions
6. **Memory Decay Testing**: Add tests for memory decay and forgetting mechanisms
7. **Memory Prioritization Testing**: Add tests for memory prioritization based on importance and recency

## Conclusion

The memory system tests provide comprehensive validation of Coda's memory capabilities, ensuring that both short-term and long-term memory components function correctly. These tests are essential for maintaining the stability and reliability of the memory system as the codebase evolves.
