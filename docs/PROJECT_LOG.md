### Memory System Investigation

**Objective**: Investigate issues with the long-term memory system not retaining information between sessions.

**Activities**:
1. Created a debug script (`debug_memory.py`) to test the memory system in isolation
2. Identified issues with ChromaDB compatibility in the memory encoder
3. Fixed the memory encoder to use primitive types for ChromaDB compatibility
4. Investigated dependency conflicts between various components
5. Reverted dependency changes to establish a clean baseline
6. Conducted a thorough analysis of the memory system architecture
7. Identified potential integration issues between the GUI and memory system

**Findings**:
- The memory system works correctly when tested in isolation
- Memories from the current session are stored correctly and visible in "View Memories"
- Memories from previous sessions aren't being effectively retrieved during conversations
- The issue appears to be with integration between the GUI and memory system, not with either component individually

**Next Steps**:
1. Gather feedback from contributors and collaborators
2. Implement recommended fixes for memory persistence and retrieval
3. Develop a plan for long-term improvements to dependency management

### Code Changes

1. Added `search_memories` method to `EnhancedMemoryManager` to delegate to `LongTermMemory.retrieve_memories`
2. Fixed memory encoder to use primitive types for ChromaDB compatibility:
   - Modified `encode_conversation` to convert lists to strings
   - Modified `encode_fact` to ensure all metadata values are primitive types
   - Modified `encode_preference` to ensure all metadata values are primitive types
   - Modified `encode_feedback` to ensure all metadata values are primitive types

### Dependency Analysis

Identified key dependency conflicts:
1. NumPy version conflicts between TTS, SciPy, Numba, and Nari-TTS
2. Pydantic version conflicts between ChromaDB and Nari-TTS
3. Torch version conflicts with Nari-TTS requirements

Recommended a dependency management approach using Poetry or similar tools rather than architectural changes to work around dependency issues.
