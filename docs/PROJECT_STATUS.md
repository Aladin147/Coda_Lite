# Coda Lite - Project Status

## Current Version: v0.0.1 (In Development)

**Last Updated:** April 22, 2023

## Overview

Coda Lite is currently in the development phase. The basic project structure has been established, and we are implementing the core components one by one. The STT module has been implemented and tested.

## Completed Items

- ✅ Project repository initialized
- ✅ Basic project structure created
- ✅ Module placeholders established
- ✅ Documentation framework set up
- ✅ Development environment set up with pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Implement speech-to-text functionality (WhisperSTT)
  - ✅ File-based transcription
  - ✅ Real-time audio capture and transcription
  - ✅ Continuous listening mode with silence detection
  - ✅ Voice Activity Detection (VAD) integration

## In Progress

- 🔄 Implementing TTS module with CSM-1B
- 🔄 Defining core interfaces between modules
- 🔄 Researching optimal model configurations

## Pending Tasks

- ⏳ Implement LLM integration (OllamaLLM)
- ⏳ Create main conversation loop
- ⏳ Implement basic tool calling

## Known Issues

- None at this stage

## Next Milestone

**Target:** v0.0.1a - Basic Voice Loop

**Estimated Completion:** May 5, 2023

**Goals:**
- ✅ Functional STT module with Whisper
- ⏳ Basic LLM integration with Ollama
- ⏳ Functional TTS module with CSM-1B
- ⏳ Simple conversation loop with minimal latency

## Performance Metrics

Preliminary testing with the STT module using the "tiny" model shows transcription times of approximately 1-2 seconds for short audio clips. Further optimization will be needed to meet the sub-3s latency target for the complete interaction cycle.
