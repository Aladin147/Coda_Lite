# Coda Lite - Project Status

## Current Version: v0.0.1 (In Development)

**Last Updated:** May 15, 2024

## Overview

Coda Lite is currently in the development phase. The basic project structure has been established, and we are implementing the core components one by one. Both the STT and TTS modules have been implemented and tested.

## Completed Items

- ✅ Project repository initialized
- ✅ Basic project structure created
- ✅ Module placeholders established
- ✅ Documentation framework set up
- ✅ Development environment set up with pre-commit hooks
- ✅ Implement speech-to-text functionality (WhisperSTT)
  - ✅ File-based transcription
  - ✅ Real-time audio capture and transcription
  - ✅ Continuous listening mode with silence detection
  - ✅ Voice Activity Detection (VAD) integration
- ✅ Implement text-to-speech functionality (CoquiTTS)
  - ✅ File-based synthesis
  - ✅ Direct audio playback
  - ✅ Multiple speaker and language support
  - ✅ Speech speed control
- ✅ Implement LLM integration with Ollama
  - ✅ Text generation with streaming support
  - ✅ Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- ✅ Create debug GUI for testing
  - ✅ Text input and response display
  - ✅ TTS playback controls
  - ✅ Performance monitoring

## In Progress

- 🔄 Creating main conversation loop
- 🔄 Researching CSM-1B integration for TTS
- 🔄 Optimizing performance for real-time interactions

## Pending Tasks

- ⏳ Implement basic tool calling
- ⏳ Replace Coqui TTS with CSM-1B
- ⏳ Create voice-activated wake word detection
- ⏳ Implement full conversation memory

## Known Issues

- Coqui TTS is using high CPU resources and sometimes fails to generate speech
- Need to implement CSM-1B for better TTS quality and performance
- GUI needs refinement for better user experience

## Next Milestone

**Target:** v0.0.1a - Basic Voice Loop

**Estimated Completion:** May 30, 2024

**Goals:**

- ✅ Functional STT module with Whisper
- ✅ Functional TTS module (currently Coqui TTS)
- ✅ Basic LLM integration with Ollama
- 🔄 Simple conversation loop with minimal latency
- ⏳ CSM-1B integration for improved TTS

## Performance Metrics

Current performance metrics:

- STT (Whisper): 1-2 seconds for short audio clips
- LLM (Ollama): 2-4 seconds for generating responses
- TTS (Coqui): 3-5 seconds for synthesizing speech with high CPU usage

Target performance for v0.0.1a:
- Complete interaction cycle under 5 seconds
- TTS synthesis under 2 seconds with CSM-1B
