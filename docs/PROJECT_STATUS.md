# Coda Lite - Project Status

## Current Version: v0.1.1 (Dashboard Integration)

**Last Updated:** May 1, 2025

## Overview

Coda Lite is in active development, with most core components implemented and functional. We have successfully integrated ElevenLabs TTS and implemented a major architecture transformation to decouple the core logic from the UI using a WebSocket-based approach. Phase 1 and 2 of the architecture transformation have been completed, providing a solid foundation for this decoupled system. We have now implemented the React-based Tauri dashboard to provide a visual interface for the system, with real-time visualization of system events, performance monitoring, and memory inspection.

## In Progress

- 🔄 Memory System Improvements
  - 🔄 Fixing persistence issues between sessions
  - 🔄 Enhancing memory retrieval during conversations
  - ✅ Resolved dependency conflicts

- 🔄 Architecture Transformation (Phases 3-5)
  - 🔄 Add security and authentication
  - 🔄 Implement advanced error handling
  - 🔄 Create comprehensive testing suite
  - 🔄 Optimize performance

- 🔄 Additional v0.1.2 Features
  - 🔄 Session summary generation

  - ⏳ Additional languages support
  - ⏳ Memory summarization for longer conversations

## Known Issues

- Memory system not effectively retrieving memories from previous sessions
- Integration between GUI and memory system causing persistence issues
- Dia TTS has GPU performance issues in some environments
- WebSocket UI implemented but requires Rust and Cargo for full Tauri functionality

## Next Milestone

**Target:** v0.1.2 - Memory System Enhancements

**Estimated Completion:** August 15, 2025

**Goals:**

- 🔄 Task management tools for productivity
- 🔄 Tool chaining implementation

**Completed in v0.1.1:**

- ✅ ElevenLabs TTS integration for improved voice quality
- ✅ Architecture transformation (Phase 1: WebSocket foundation)
- ✅ Architecture transformation (Phase 2: Core Integration)
- ✅ React-based Tauri dashboard implementation
- ✅ Real-time visualization of system events
- ✅ Performance monitoring and metrics display
- ✅ Memory inspection and visualization
- ✅ Tool usage tracking and display
- ✅ WebSocket server compatibility with websockets 15.0.1+

## Performance Metrics

Current performance metrics:

- STT (Whisper): 0.8-1.5 seconds for short audio clips
- LLM (Ollama): 1.5-3 seconds for generating responses
- TTS (Dia/CSM-1B): 1-2 seconds for synthesizing speech with GPU
- TTS (ElevenLabs): 0.8-1.5 seconds for synthesizing speech via API
- End-to-end latency: 3.5-6 seconds

Target performance for v0.1.2:

- End-to-end latency under 3 seconds
- TTS synthesis under 0.8 seconds with ElevenLabs
- Memory retrieval under 100ms
- Dashboard rendering under 50ms
