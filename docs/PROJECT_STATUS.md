# Coda Lite - Project Status

## Current Version: v0.1.0 (Working toward v0.1.1)

**Last Updated:** April 26, 2025

## Overview

Coda Lite is in active development, with most core components implemented and functional. We have successfully integrated ElevenLabs TTS and implemented a major architecture transformation to decouple the core logic from the UI using a WebSocket-based approach. Phase 1 and 2 of the architecture transformation have been completed, providing a solid foundation for this decoupled system. We are now working on implementing the React-based Tauri dashboard to provide a visual interface for the system.

## Completed Items

- ✅ Core Components
  - ✅ STT module with Whisper (GPU-accelerated)
  - ✅ LLM integration with Ollama
  - ✅ TTS module with MeloTTS (CSM-1B), Dia TTS, and ElevenLabs
  - ✅ Multiple English voices (US, British, Australian, Indian)
  - ✅ Concurrent processing with threading for reduced latency

- ✅ Advanced Features
  - ✅ Advanced personality engine with behavioral conditioning
  - ✅ Long-term memory with vector embeddings and semantic search
  - ✅ Intent routing system with pattern-based detection
  - ✅ User feedback hooks for collecting and processing feedback
  - ✅ Memory-based personality conditioning system
  - ✅ Mini-command language with system commands

- ✅ Tool System
  - ✅ Two-pass tool calling implementation
  - ✅ JSON cleaning to reduce leakage
  - ✅ Enhanced error handling and fallbacks
  - ✅ Basic tools (`get_time()`, `get_date()`, `tell_joke()`, etc.)

- ✅ Development Infrastructure
  - ✅ Debug GUI for testing and development
  - ✅ Comprehensive documentation
  - ✅ Performance monitoring and optimization

  - 🔄 Memory explainability
  - 🔄 Task management tools
  - 🔄 Tool chaining implementation

- ⏳ Future Enhancements
  - ⏳ Wake word detection
  - ⏳ Token streaming for real-time TTS
  - ⏳ Additional languages support
  - ⏳ Memory summarization for longer conversations

## Known Issues

- Memory system not effectively retrieving memories from previous sessions
- Integration between GUI and memory system causing persistence issues
- Dia TTS has GPU performance issues in some environments
- WebSocket UI not yet fully implemented

## Next Milestone

**Target:** v0.1.1 - Dashboard Integration

**Estimated Completion:** July 15, 2025

**Goals:**

- ✅ ElevenLabs TTS integration for improved voice quality
- ✅ Architecture transformation (Phase 1: WebSocket foundation)
- ✅ Architecture transformation (Phase 2: Core Integration)
- 🔄 React-based Tauri dashboard implementation
- 🔄 Memory system improvements for reliable persistence
- 🔄 Session summary generation for conversation sessions
- 🔄 Memory explainability for insights into what Coda remembers
- 🔄 Task management tools for productivity
- 🔄 Tool chaining implementation

## Performance Metrics

Current performance metrics:

- STT (Whisper): 0.8-1.5 seconds for short audio clips
- LLM (Ollama): 1.5-3 seconds for generating responses
- TTS (Dia/CSM-1B): 1-2 seconds for synthesizing speech with GPU
- TTS (ElevenLabs): 0.8-1.5 seconds for synthesizing speech via API
- End-to-end latency: 3.5-6 seconds

Target performance for v0.1.0:

- End-to-end latency under 3 seconds
- TTS synthesis under 0.8 seconds with ElevenLabs
- Memory retrieval under 100ms
