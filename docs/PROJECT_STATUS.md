# Coda Lite - Project Status

## Current Version: v0.0.9 (Working toward v0.1.0)

**Last Updated:** April 25, 2025

## Overview

Coda Lite is in active development, with most core components implemented and functional. We are currently working on integrating ElevenLabs TTS and implementing a major architecture transformation to decouple the core logic from the UI using a WebSocket-based approach. Phase 1 of the architecture transformation has been completed, providing the foundation for this decoupled system.

## Completed Items

- ✅ Core Components
  - ✅ STT module with Whisper (GPU-accelerated)
  - ✅ LLM integration with Ollama
  - ✅ TTS module with MeloTTS (CSM-1B) and Dia TTS
  - ✅ Multiple English voices (US, British, Australian, Indian)
  - ✅ Concurrent processing with threading for reduced latency

- ✅ Advanced Features
  - ✅ Advanced personality engine with behavioral conditioning
  - ✅ Long-term memory with vector embeddings and semantic search
  - ✅ Intent routing system with pattern-based detection
  - ✅ User feedback hooks for collecting and processing feedback
  - ✅ Memory-based personality conditioning system
  - ✅ Mini-command language with system commands

- ✅ Tool System
  - ✅ Two-pass tool calling implementation
  - ✅ JSON cleaning to reduce leakage
  - ✅ Enhanced error handling and fallbacks
  - ✅ Basic tools (`get_time()`, `get_date()`, `tell_joke()`, etc.)

- ✅ Development Infrastructure
  - ✅ Debug GUI for testing and development
  - ✅ Comprehensive documentation
  - ✅ Performance monitoring and optimization

## In Progress

  - ⏳ Implement advanced error handling
  - ⏳ Create comprehensive testing suite
  - ⏳ Optimize performance

- ⏳ v0.1.0 Features
  - ⏳ Session summary generation
  - ⏳ Memory explainability
  - ⏳ Task management tools
  - ⏳ Tool chaining implementation

- ⏳ Future Enhancements
  - ⏳ Wake word detection
  - ⏳ Token streaming for real-time TTS
  - ⏳ Additional languages support
  - ⏳ Memory summarization for longer conversations

## Known Issues

- Memory system not effectively retrieving memories from previous sessions
- Integration between GUI and memory system causing persistence issues
- Dependency conflicts between various components (NumPy, Pydantic, Torch)
- Dia TTS has GPU performance issues in some environments

## Next Milestone

**Target:** v0.1.0 - Alpha Candidate

**Estimated Completion:** June 30, 2025

**Goals:**

- 🔄 ElevenLabs TTS integration for improved voice quality
- ✅ Architecture transformation (Phase 1: WebSocket foundation)
- 🔄 Architecture transformation (Phase 2: Core Integration)
- 🔄 Memory system improvements for reliable persistence
- ⏳ Session summary generation for conversation sessions
- ⏳ Memory explainability for insights into what Coda remembers
- ⏳ Task management tools for productivity
- ⏳ Tool chaining implementation

## Performance Metrics

Current performance metrics:

- STT (Whisper): 0.8-1.5 seconds for short audio clips
- LLM (Ollama): 1.5-3 seconds for generating responses
- TTS (Dia/CSM-1B): 1-2 seconds for synthesizing speech with GPU
- End-to-end latency: 3.5-6 seconds

Target performance for v0.1.0:

- End-to-end latency under 3 seconds
- TTS synthesis under 1 second with ElevenLabs
- Memory retrieval under 100ms
