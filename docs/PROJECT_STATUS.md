## Completed Items

- ‚úÖ Project repository initialized
- ‚úÖ Basic project structure created
- ‚úÖ Module placeholders established
- ‚úÖ Documentation framework set up

## In Progress

- üîÑ Setting up development environment
- üîÑ Defining core interfaces between modules
- üîÑ Researching optimal model configurations

## Pending Tasks

- ‚è≥ Implement speech-to-text functionality (WhisperSTT)
- ‚è≥ Implement LLM integration (OllamaLLM)
- ‚è≥ Implement text-to-speech functionality (CSMTTS)
- ‚è≥ Create main conversation loop
- ‚è≥ Implement basic tool calling

## Known Issues

- None at this stage (pre-implementation)

## Next Milestone

**Target:** v0.0.1a - Basic Voice Loop

**Estimated Completion:** [Date TBD]

**Goals:**
- Functional STT module with Whisper
- Basic LLM integration with Ollama
