# Dashboard v3 Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing Dashboard v3, a new version of the Coda dashboard that addresses the issues encountered in previous versions and provides a stable, maintainable foundation for future development.

## Goals
- Create a stable, performant dashboard for Coda
- Implement proper state management from the beginning
- Avoid React infinite update loops and other performance issues
- Provide a clean, modern UI with good user experience
- Ensure maintainability and extensibility

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18+
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS v3 (more stable than v4)
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **WebSocket**: Custom WebSocket service with proper connection management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Create a new branch `dashboard-v3` from `v0.1.1-development`
2. Initialize a new React project with Vite
3. Set up Tailwind CSS v3
4. Configure ESLint and Prettier
5. Set up basic project structure

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure
1. Implement WebSocket service with proper connection management
2. Create Zustand stores for global state
3. Set up basic routing (if needed)
4. Implement error boundary components
5. Create utility functions for common operations

### Phase 3: Basic UI Components
1. Implement Layout component
2. Create a simplified Avatar component
3. Implement basic ConversationView
4. Create VoiceControls with push-to-talk functionality
5. Implement basic SystemInfo component

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Enhance Avatar with state-based animations
2. Implement PerformanceMonitor with charts
3. Create MemoryViewer with filtering and search
4. Add debug controls and developer tools
5. Implement settings and configuration UI

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
1. Write unit tests for critical components
2. Perform integration testing
3. Optimize performance
4. Refine UI and UX
5. Address any remaining issues

### Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment
1. Update documentation
2. Create user guide
3. Prepare for deployment
4. Final testing
5. Merge to main branch

## Component Architecture

### Layout
- Main layout component that structures the dashboard
- Handles responsive design and dark mode

### Avatar
- Visual representation of Coda
- Displays current mode and emotion
- Animates based on Coda's state

### ConversationView
- Displays conversation history
- Shows user inputs and Coda's responses
- Supports markdown rendering and code highlighting

### PerformanceMonitor
- Displays real-time performance metrics
- Shows processing time for STT, LLM, TTS
- Visualizes system resource usage

### MemoryViewer
- Displays Coda's memory system data
- Allows filtering and searching memories
- Shows memory importance and context

### VoiceControls
- Provides push-to-talk functionality
- Includes demo mode for showcasing Coda
- Shows recording status and feedback

### SystemInfo
- Displays system resource usage
- Shows connection status
- Provides system health indicators

## State Management

### Connection State
- WebSocket connection status
- Reconnection attempts
- Connection quality

### Coda Mode
- Current operational mode (idle, listening, thinking, speaking)
- Previous mode for transitions
- Mode duration

### Events
- WebSocket event history
- Event filtering and search
- Event replay

### Performance Metrics
- Processing time metrics
- System resource usage
- Historical performance data

### Memories
- Memory system data
- Memory importance and context
- Memory search and filtering

## Best Practices

### Component Design
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use React.memo for pure components
- Avoid inline function definitions in render methods
- Use proper dependency arrays in hooks

### State Management
- Minimize component state for UI-only concerns
- Use Zustand for shared state
- Avoid prop drilling by using context or state management
- Ensure stable references for objects and functions

### Performance
- Lazy load components when possible
- Use virtualization for long lists
- Debounce frequent events
- Profile and optimize render performance

### Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries for component failures
- Provide fallback UI for error states
- Log errors for debugging
- Implement retry mechanisms for network operations

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Project setup and core infrastructure
- **Week 2**: Basic UI components
- **Week 3**: Advanced features
- **Week 4**: Testing and refinement
- **Week 5**: Documentation and deployment

## Success Criteria
- Dashboard loads and connects to WebSocket server
- All components render without errors
- No infinite update loops or performance issues
- UI is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- All features from previous dashboard versions are implemented
- Code is well-documented and maintainable
