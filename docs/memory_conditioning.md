# Memory-Based Personality Conditioning

Memory-Based Personality Conditioning is a system that allows Coda to learn from user feedback stored in memory and adjust its personality parameters accordingly. This creates a more adaptive and personalized experience.

## Overview

The Memory-Based Personality Conditioning system consists of several components:

1. **Memory Conditioner**: Analyzes feedback patterns from memory, identifies consistent preferences, and adjusts personality parameters based on feedback history.
2. **Feedback Storage**: Stores feedback in long-term memory for later analysis.
3. **Feedback Pattern Analysis**: Detects consistent positive or negative feedback, identifies improving or declining trends, and generates insights and recommendations.
4. **Feedback Pattern Application**: Adjusts personality parameters based on feedback, reinforces successful interactions, and corrects problematic behavior.
5. **User Preference Insights**: Identifies preferred communication styles, detects preferred levels of verbosity, formality, etc., and provides recommendations for improvement.

## Feedback Patterns

The system can detect several types of feedback patterns:

- **Consistent Positive**: Consistently positive feedback on a specific aspect
- **Consistent Negative**: Consistently negative feedback on a specific aspect
- **Mixed**: A mix of positive and negative feedback
- **Improving**: Feedback that is improving over time
- **Declining**: Feedback that is declining over time
- **Insufficient**: Not enough feedback to determine a pattern

## Parameter Mapping

Different types of feedback are mapped to different personality parameters:

- **Tone**: Formality, assertiveness
- **Verbosity**: Verbosity
- **Helpfulness**: Proactivity
- **Accuracy**: Assertiveness
- **General**: All parameters (verbosity, formality, humor, assertiveness, proactivity)

## Automatic Application

The system automatically applies feedback patterns:

- Every 10 turns during normal conversation
- When explicitly requested via the `#apply_feedback` command

## Commands

The following commands are available for interacting with the Memory-Based Personality Conditioning system:

- `#apply_feedback`: Apply feedback patterns to personality
- `#personality_insight`: Show current personality settings and learned preferences
- `#view_feedback [type]`: View feedback history or specific type
- `#view_feedback_memories [type]`: View feedback memories from long-term memory
- `#feedback [type]`: Request specific feedback (helpfulness, memory, tone, verbosity, accuracy, general)

## Implementation Details

The Memory-Based Personality Conditioning system is implemented in the following files:

- `personality/memory_conditioning.py`: The main implementation of the Memory Conditioner
- `personality/advanced_personality_manager.py`: Integration with the Advanced Personality Manager
- `memory/enhanced_memory_manager.py`: Storage of feedback in long-term memory
- `intent/handlers.py`: Command handlers for interacting with the system
- `feedback/feedback_manager.py`: Management of feedback collection and processing

## Benefits

The Memory-Based Personality Conditioning system provides several benefits:

1. **Adaptive Personality**: Coda can adapt its personality based on user feedback.
2. **Personalized Experience**: Users get a more personalized experience as Coda learns their preferences.
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Coda continuously improves its interactions based on feedback.
4. **Transparent Learning**: Users can see what Coda has learned about their preferences.
5. **Feedback-Driven Development**: The system uses feedback to drive personality development.

## Example

Here's an example of how the system works:

1. User provides feedback on Coda's verbosity: "You're being too verbose."
2. The feedback is stored in long-term memory with a negative sentiment.
3. After several similar feedback instances, the system detects a consistent negative pattern for verbosity.
4. The system adjusts the verbosity parameter to be lower.
5. The user can see the adjustment through the `#personality_insight` command.
6. The user can manually apply feedback patterns with the `#apply_feedback` command.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to the Memory-Based Personality Conditioning system include:

1. **Enhanced Feedback Analysis**: Improve the analysis of feedback patterns with more sophisticated algorithms.
2. **Multi-Modal Feedback**: Support feedback from different sources (text, voice, etc.).
3. **Feedback Visualization**: Provide visual representations of feedback patterns.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Implement a reinforcement learning approach to personality adjustment.
