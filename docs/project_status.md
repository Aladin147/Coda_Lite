## Known Issues

- ⚠️ Dashboard npm environment issues after PC restart
- ⚠️ WebSocket connection port mismatch between dashboard and server
- ⚠️ WebSocket asyncio errors with 'AssertionError: assert f is self._write_fut'
- ⚠️ Message duplication in WebSocket (x4, x6, x8)
- ⚠️ Warnings about missing event loops in current threads
- ⚠️ ChromaDB vector database not always available
- ⚠️ Missing ConfigLoader.get_all() method and system prompt file
- ⚠️ STT segmentation faults possibly related to missing cuDNN library

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Stability (Current Focus)

1. Fix WebSocket implementation issues:

   - Implement proper event loop handling with asyncio
   - Add duplicate message detection system
   - Fix asyncio errors in WebSocket communication
   - Implement WebSocket authentication

2. Complete TTS improvements:

   - Finalize ElevenLabs integration
   - Ensure proper resource management with lazy loading
   - Implement seamless switching between TTS providers
   - Add fallback mechanisms for offline operation

3. Address remaining memory system issues:

   - Fix ChromaDB availability issues
   - Implement ConfigLoader.get_all() method
   - Create missing system prompt file
   - Add memory snapshot capabilities

4. Implement core debugging tools:

   - Create ConversationPipelineDebugger
   - Implement memory_snapshot.json emitter
   - Add debug_cache flag for caching visualization
   - Develop basic watchdog process

### Phase 2: Observability (Next Focus)

1. Implement comprehensive logging:

   - Create structured logging system
   - Add performance tracking for all components
   - Implement event tracking and analytics
   - Develop health monitoring API

2. Create performance dashboards:
